This app presents the user with a list of viber contacts to call. 
It's made for older people who are forced to use viber to talk to others and
is thus intentionally very simple and limited in functionality.
If the user presses on the contacts list for longer than 5 seconds 
they will be presented with a launcher to load other apps - this makes it
possible for more tech savvy users to configure the phone and unlikely for the
older person to accidentally open the launcher.
